# My Favorite Sports Teams

My favorite sports teams are:  
- [St. Louis Cardinals](https://www.mlb.com/cardinals)
- [Dallas Mavericks](https://www.mavs.com)
- [FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/)

Soccer is probably my favorite sport which is **surprising** because I did not start following it until I got into highschool. Basketball is my second favorite sport because thats the one I played the most growing up. I could play it alone or with other people. I *honestly* don't know why I like baseball. I just do. Kinda relaxing honestly.

P.S. If any sports teams are looking for an I.T. guy here's my FizzBuzz already completed!

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Fizz Buzz</title>
    <script>

    function fizzbuzz() {
      var display = document.getElementById('display');
      var displayHTML = "";
      for (i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        var result = "";
        if (i % 3 == 0) result = "Fizz";
        if (i % 5 == 0) result = "Buzz"
        if (!result) result = i;
        displayHTML += "<p>" + result + "</p>";
      }
      display.innerHTML = displayHTML
    }

    </script>

    </head>

    <body onload="fizzbuzz()">
    <div id="display">
