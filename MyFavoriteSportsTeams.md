# My Favorite Sports Teams

My favorite sports teams are:  
- [St. Louis Cardinals](https://www.mlb.com/cardinals)
- [Dallas Mavericks](https://www.mavs.com)
- [FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/)

Soccer is probably my favorite sport which is surprising because I did not start following it until I got into highschool. Basketball is my second favorite sport because thats the one I played the most growing up. I could play it alone or with other people. I honestly don't know why I like baseball. I just do. Kinda relaxing honestly.
