# Things to do in Columbia

Since I was born in [Columbia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Flag_of_Columbia%2C_Missouri.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Columbia%2C_Missouri.svg.png) you'd *think* I'd know some of the best things to do around here. Well I **don't**. However I will provide a list of some things I enjoy doing in Columbia.
