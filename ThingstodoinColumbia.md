# Things to do in Columbia

Since I was born in Columbia you'd think I'd know some of the best things to do around here. Well I don't. However I will provide a list of some things I enjoy doing in Columbia.

- Chill out at [Lakota Coffee](https://www.lakotacoffee.com)
- Watch [Mizzou](https://mutigers.com/feature/MizzouTickets) sporting events
- Enjoying local [restaurants](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g44257-Columbia_Missouri.html) 
- Walk around one of the many [parks](https://www.como.gov/parksandrec/)
