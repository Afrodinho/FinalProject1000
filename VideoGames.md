In my free time I enjoy playing **video games**. I like to play both single *and* multiplayer games. The game I probably play the most is the yearly iteration of FIFA. When I need a break from that I play whatever singleplayer games are out at that time.

### My favorite Games of All Time

- Final Fantasy VII
- The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time
- Fallout: New Vegas
- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
- The Witcher 3
- Any Assassin's Creed game
- Mass Effect Trilogy
