#### Fun Facts About Me
I once made a block of code in python. Lets see how it works in Markdown!

def myFunction() :
    return True

if myFunction() :

    print('aboutme.py')
        
    print('Kaden Marshall')
        
    print('I am 22 years old and my birthday is October 22nd')
        
    print('I was born in Columbia, MO')
        
    print('I am 6 feet 1 inch')
        
    print('My favorite sports are soccer, basketball, and baseball')
        
    print('I have a Labradoodle named Callie')
        
    print('I am using a 15 inch Macbook Pro')
        
    print('this is a block of code!')
    
else:

    print('this did not work')
    
    print('try again')

It doesn't *work* the same here **obviously**. But hopefully you learned something about me.
